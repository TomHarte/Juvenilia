# Anarchy, QBASIC attempt [c. 1995/6]

Anarchy was intended to be a remake of the ZX Spectrum game, Chaos. This was my first attempt at the project.

This is some of my earliest surviving source code and shows significant evidence of overreach, as well as an unclear approach to version control â€” I believe all individual source included to be different versions of the same work.  

With no access to graphics texts or the internet, the rotating isometric viewpoint is as much as I had yet figured out for myself:
  * inspiration may have been a comment in an old Electron User about a circle looking like an ellipse when laid flat;
  * from there I remember having a lot of difficulty as an early-teen coming up with the idea of basis vectors. 

These files were recovered from an old floppy disk, likely an active work disk.
