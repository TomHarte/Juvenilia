# iPhone Work, 2008

Prior to returning to development as a full-time career, in 2008 I was involved in the development of a handful of iPhone titles as a hobbyist. This is what survives of those.

## Miners

Miners was a two-day project, was published within the first 10,000 iOS titles, and if memory serves it made a profit of something like Â£1,200; sales were easy to come by in the very early days of the App Store.

Source code is lost.

## Deathball

Unfinished and unreleased; a game designed by [Hawken King](http://www.hawkenking.com) which was a twist on the then-popular tilt-controlled rolling ball genre.

Source code and assets survive but as it was a collaborative effort I'll need to enquire before publishing.

This was an OpenGL ES 1.1 title, i.e. it uses the pre-2.0 fixed pipeline, but with the ES twist of no immediate mode. It was also prior to my getting especially well-acquainted with either Objective-C or then-semi-recent C++ so it looks a lot like C with better scoping.
