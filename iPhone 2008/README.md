# iPhone Work, 2008

Prior to returning to development as a full-time career, in 2008 I was involved in the development of a handful of iPhone titles as a hobbyist. This is what survives of those.

## Miners

Miners was a two-day project, was published within the first 10,000 iOS titles, and if memory serves it made a profit of something like Â£1,200; sales were easy to come by in the very early days of the App Store.

Source code is lost.
